# Requirements

The extraction of crown images and crown indices requires a compatible crown delineation file. The function [`check_crownsFile()`](https://umr-amap.github.io/canObsR/reference/check_crownsFile.html) tests each requirement of the file and return the necessary modifications to do to make the file compatible.  

To be compatible with the package functions the crown delineation file must have :  
- at least the variables ‘id’, ‘species’, ‘genus’ and ‘family’  
- ‘species’, ‘genus’ and ‘family’ should not have NA. Replace them by ‘indet’  
- ‘id’ should not have duplicated values.  

# Check the compatibility and adapt the file

The following example use the crown delineation file from the test data, but the process is the same for any crown delineation file. 

Add crownfile to test data and continue the article
