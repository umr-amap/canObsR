\title{Detect conda installation or offer Miniconda installation}
\usage{
detect_conda(verbose = TRUE, auto_select = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{verbose}{logical. If \code{TRUE} (default), displays informational messages during execution.}

\item{auto_select}{logical. If \code{TRUE} (default), automatically selects the conda path if only one is found.}
}
\value{
A character string with the full path to the selected \code{conda} executable, or \code{NULL} if no conda was found and the user declined the Miniconda installation.
}
\description{
This function automatically searches for available \code{conda} executables in common system paths.
If none are found, it offers to install Miniconda using the \code{reticulate} package.
}
\details{
The function first checks if \code{conda} is available in the system \code{PATH}. If not, it searches for common installation
directories of Anaconda and Miniconda. If still no installation is found, the user is prompted to install Miniconda.

Once a valid \code{conda} executable is found (or installed), its directory is added to the current R session \code{PATH}.
